xraystyle's Google Apps User Provisioning Tool


This is a small app that acts as a CLI for your Google Apps domain.

The app uses the Google Apps provisioning API Ruby client found here: http://code.google.com/p/gdatav2rubyclientlib/

This app also makes use of the Highline gem for more advanced control over user input. 
More info on that here: http://highline.rubyforge.org/

Currently the app can list user info given a username, and add and delete users from the domain. The app can also list all the users in the domain, either just by username, or by full user info.

The plan is that this app will eventually be able to send welcome emails to newly added users and be able to manage group membership as well.
